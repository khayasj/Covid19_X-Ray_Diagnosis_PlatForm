# ü¶† X-COVID Insight ‚Äî AI-Powered COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Diagnosis Platform

A full-stack web application combining deep learning‚Äìbased COVID-19 diagnosis with a multi-role clinic management system.

## üîç Overview
X-COVID Insight is designed to streamline COVID-19 testing and diagnosis by analyzing chest X-rays with deep learning models, reducing doctor workload, and automating feedback-driven model improvement. The platform supports multiple user roles and integrates real-world clinic workflows, from booking and image upload to AI diagnosis and incremental retraining.

## üß† AI Model Architecture

### Lung Segmentation (UNet + ResNet34)
- Trained using COVID-19 Radiography Dataset
- Extracts lung regions to focus classifier attention and reduce noise
- Preprocessed with data augmentation and Dice + BCE loss for accuracy
- Target Dice score ‚â• 95%

### Classification (DenseNet121)
- Input: segmented lung images (224√ó224)
- Output: 4 categories (COVID-19, Lung Opacity, Normal, Viral Pneumonia)
- Fine-tuned using transfer learning, custom normalization, and class-balanced training
- Macro F1-score target: ‚â• 90%

### Confidence & Incremental Training
- <80% confidence predictions or random high-confidence samples sent to doctors for validation
- Doctor feedback used to incrementally retrain model via FastAPI
- Retrained model is deployed only if Macro F1 improves on evaluation set
